# Portfolio and projects

## Description
I am currently trying to learn some skills for my technical interviews. I am mostly applying for Data Science, Data Analytics, and Business Analytics. In order to push my skillset, I want to implement a couple of projects that would cover those basic skills (outlined below) but on the level of Mid/Senior Analyst (I need to really step-up my skills).

## Skills that I want to improve
Herea are the lists of all the skills I want to improve 

Languages and Frameworks:
1. Python 3 
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. SQLite
4. SQL language

Libraries and Frameworks:
1. Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
2. sqlite3
3. XGBoost
4. AutoML: e.g., with XGBoost
5. Shap Values

Knowledge base:
1. Regression
2. Classification
3. Hyperparameters
4. Basic Data Engineering
5. Data Cleaning
6. Features Design (aka. figure out which features are helpful, useless, etc.)
7. Correlation Analysis

Language Processing-Specifi:
1. LLMs and APIs
2. Transformers
3. BERT
4. Google Colab and using GPU/TPU there

## Outline of projects and what they should cover

I want to have three projects. Here are the requirements for the projects

1. One project that tackles a classification problem
2. One project that tackles a regression problem
3. One project that tackles AutoML (hyperparameters and stuff)

## Data for the projects
**I want to have one project per datasets. Here are the datasets:**

The first Dataset is a typical ML classification/regression Dataset. The second and the third one are more NLP-related (which is what I want to train the most).

1. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ak0212/anxiety-and-depression-mental-health-factors/data 
    - Description: This dataset contains related to anxiety, depression, and mental health influences. It includes demographic details, lifestyle habits, mental health indicators, medical history, coping mechanisms, and stress factors. The dataset is designed for mental health analysis, predictive modeling, and research on the impact of various factors on mental well-being.
    - Columns: Age,Gender,Education_Level,Employment_Status,Sleep_Hours,Physical_Activity_Hrs,Social_Support_Score,Anxiety_Score,Depression_Score,Stress_Level,Family_History_Mental_Illness,Chronic_Illnesses,Medication_Use,Therapy,Meditation,Substance_Use,Financial_Stress,Work_Stress,Self_Esteem_Score,Life_Satisfaction_Score,Loneliness_Score
2. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis
    - Description:
        - Overview. This is an entity-level sentiment analysis dataset of twitter. Given a message and an entity, the task is to judge the sentiment of the message about the entity. There are three classes in this dataset: Positive, Negative and Neutral. We regard messages that are not relevant to the entity (i.e. Irrelevant) as Neutral.
        - Usage. Please use twitter_training.csv as the training set and twitter_validation.csv as the validation set. Top 1 classification accuracy is used as the metric.
    - Columns: Tweet ID,entity,sentiment,Tweet content
3. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapturovalexander/consumer-sentiments-and-ratings 
    - Description: This dataset contains customer reviews for various products, including details about product categories, brands, user ratings, and sentiment analysis. The dataset can be used for sentiment classification, recommendation systems, and consumer behavior analysis. 
    - Columns: item_category: The category ID of the product being reviewed; item_id: The unique identifier of the specific product; brand: The brand ID associated with the product; user_id: The unique identifier of the customer who left the review; date: The date when the review was posted (YYYY-MM-DD); comment: The textual content of the review provided by the user; rating: The numerical rating given by the user (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 5); tonality: The sentiment classification of the review (e.g., positive, negative).

## Expected outcome of these training projects

- I want to master all the Skills mentioned in **Skills that I want to improve** 
- I want step by step guidance
- I want medium-size theoretical backgrounds. E.g., what is the purpose of this Cell; which concept and where I can ream more about it, small tips, etc.
