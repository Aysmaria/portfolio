# Mental Health Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building a classification model to predict anxiety and depression levels based on various mental health factors. It utilizes the [Anxiety and Depression Mental Health Factors](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ak0212/anxiety-and-depression-mental-health-factors/data) dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Goals
- Develop a classification model to predict mental health categories
- Explore relationships between lifestyle factors and mental health outcomes
- Apply data cleaning, feature engineering, and model optimization techniques

## Skills Covered
- Python data analysis with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib
- Classification algorithms
- Feature importance analysis using SHAP values
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Correlation analysis
- Model evaluation and optimization

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes demographic details, lifestyle habits, mental health indicators, medical history, coping mechanisms, and stress factors. Key columns include:
- Demographic: Age, Gender, Education_Level, Employment_Status
- Lifestyle: Sleep_Hours, Physical_Activity_Hrs, Social_Support_Score
- Health Indicators: Anxiety_Score, Depression_Score, Stress_Level
- Medical: Family_History_Mental_Illness, Chronic_Illnesses, Medication_Use
- Coping: Therapy, Meditation, Substance_Use
- Stressors: Financial_Stress, Work_Stress
- Wellbeing: Self_Esteem_Score, Life_Satisfaction_Score, Loneliness_Score
