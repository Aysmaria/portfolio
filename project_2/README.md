# Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis with BERT and APIs

## Overview
This project focuses on applying BERT and other transformer models to predict sentiment for entities mentioned in tweets. It utilizes the [Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis) dataset from Kaggle and is designed to run in Google Colab with GPU/TPU acceleration.

## Project Goals
- Apply BERT and transformer models to entity-level sentiment analysis
- Compare performance of custom-trained models vs. external NLP APIs
- Optimize model performance using GPU/TPU acceleration in Google Colab
- Develop entity-specific sentiment extraction techniques

## Skills Covered
- Google Colab environment setup with GPU/TPU acceleration
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- BERT, RoBERTa, and other transformer architectures
- NLP preprocessing for transformers
- Model comparison and evaluation

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains Twitter messages and named entities with sentiment labels. Key columns include:
- Tweet ID: Unique identifier for each tweet
- Entity: The named entity mentioned in the tweet
- Sentiment: The sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
- Tweet content: The actual text of the tweet
